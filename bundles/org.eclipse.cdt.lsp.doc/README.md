# Language Server based C/C++ Editor Documentation

## AsciiDoc content

The Asciidoctor Maven Plugin is configured to generate an HTML file in the `html/` folder for each AsciiDoc source file (`*.adoc`) placed in the `src/asciidoc/` folder.

All AsciiDoc source files should include GitHub rendering support.

During content development, HTML files may be generated by invoking Maven locally:

```
mvn generate-resources
```
