= C/{cpp} editor (LSP)

The CDT provides a Language Server based editor that gives you specific support for editing C/{cpp} code.
This editor uses _Language Server Protocol_ (LSP) to provide better support for modern C/{cpp} language features than the legacy C/{cpp} editor.
The Language Server based editor is invoked automatically when you open a C/{cpp} source file within new projects.
Projects created using an older version of CDT may be configured to use this editor from the menu:Project[Preferences > C/{cpp} General > Editor (LSP)] properties page:

The C/{cpp} editor (LSP) includes the following features:

- Syntax highlighting
- Content/code assist
- Code folding
- Integrated debugging features

You can customize formatting behaviour of the editor by modifying style options in the _link:https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html[ClangFormat]_ configuration file from the menu:Project[Preferences > C/{cpp} General > Editor (LSP) > Formatter] properties page.

IMPORTANT: The C/{cpp} editor (LSP) requires an installation of the `link:https://clangd.llvm.org[clangd]` command-line tool. Refer to link:lsp_clangd_prefs.html[clangd preferences] for setup details.
